For each employee(role, department)
The metrics in the PerformanceMetrics class represent percepts about that employeeâ€™s current state. 
They are effectively observations about the performance of the employee.

    Performance_Metrics Class:
        * A class to manage different perormances (which are percepted from the Employee's Env)
        * Metrics are determined based on roles (Different Env for each role)
    # State represents the information an agent knows about the world at any given point.
        Each Metrics is a representation of different state for an employee
